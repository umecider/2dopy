    #keeping these basic for now, but alternate views and asking for stats would go here aswell
add task
    prompt for name of task
    prompt for due date (see if there's a date parser)
    take current date/time
    create new row in pandas database, with task, due date, creation date, completion date, and status (done/incomplete)
    #would be nice to also add an "abandon" task mode just to get stats on that aswell
    report completion status
    return to main view
complete task
    mark task as complete, this should remove it from the main view(?)
    #might be nice to add it as a completed task for the day
    return to main view w/ little message :)
delete task
    confirm deletion status
    delete from database
    return w/ message.
edit task  
    update fields
